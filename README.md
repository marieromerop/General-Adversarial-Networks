# General-Adversarial-Networks

Hello, 

This repos is for resume purposes-- to display the projects I've worked on. The purpose of this task was to use Convolutional Neural Networks to interpret and generate fake handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset. The .png files are outputs of the generative model after training epochs in intervals of 10. If you'd like to play around with it, you must download the .ipynb file and have a virtual environment-- preferably jupyter notebook or google colab-- to run it.
